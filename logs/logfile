Hereafter are the logging of our new found best values/algorithms/parameters

We started by implementing the ALS with missing entries on our data set (with matrix factorization), which is producing our best result on kaggle so far with an RMSE of: 0.98916 with the parameters: k = 3, lambda_user = 0.2, and lambda_item = 0.9

With SGD, the best is now k = 9, l_u = 0.1, l_i = 0.009, gamma = 0.04 with RMSE: 0.97849, LOCAL_RMSE = 0.95987399
